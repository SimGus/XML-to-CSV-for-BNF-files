         translate button
         output pane
         clear logs button
      - options
         language -> drop down menu
         drop down menu for the output format
         check box to know if we can translate a directory
      - description

TODOS
   DONE the tags should be case sensitive
   DONE don't make it all in one method
   DONE check if one field is already filled (don't wipe out when adding something)
   DONE check if the file we will write has the same extension than what is in the drop down menu
   DONE add check box to know if we can translate a directory + backend
   DONE add all EAD tags in HashMap
   DONE translate special XML characters
   DONE parser returns false if the file cannot be translated (=> don't create it)
   DONE add clear output button
   NOPE TODO translate directories recursively + add checkbox?

   DONE multiple manuscripts in one XML file (!!!)
   DONE replace numérisation-fac-similé
   DONE contentscope in contenu
   DONE custodhist placed in contenu CHECK
   DONE put things that have not Thomas's consent in a debug field
   DONE cotes (take the first word)
   DONE date -> siècle
   DONE add BNF field
   DONE remove .tsv
   DONE translate directories in only one file
   DONE put 'ancienne cote' in last fields
   DONE multithread display
   NOPE TODO multithread translation? NOT THE TIME
   TODO write a file every X files translated to prevent excessive memory consumption
   DONE check foliotation
   DONE check division
   DONE replace '/' by '%'
   DONE checkbox for the splitting or not
   DONE ancienne cote (NEED RESOURCE)
   DONE don't stop everything if one error
   DONE remove exception thrown when missing quotes
   DONE error counting
   DONE add initial capacity to ArrayList and HashMaps
   DONE (CHECK?) make a new entry for fragment only if date for a fragment is provided in the current XML file
   DONE replace '%' by "%%"
   DONE check for spaces around "%%"
   DONE check for spaces in dates
   DONE make it deterministic by sorting the files

Interpreter :  read the tree of the file
               each time you encounter a tag that could contain something interesting keep on searching
                                       a tag that doesn't contain anything valuable stop
                                       a tag that can be simplified to the value (or value of an attribute it contains), simplify and put it in the HashMap
               finally you get a HashMap containing all the fields of the database and their value

               => 3 types :   - keep on going down the tree
                              - get what's inside and that correspond to a database field
                              - you've gone too far, there might be a problem with the file
