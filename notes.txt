GUI :
   2 tabs
      - main
         choose file to translate -> edit text
         browse button
         choose file to write -> edit text
         translate button
         output pane
      - options
         language -> drop down menu
         drop down menu for the output format
         TODO add check box to know if we can translate a directory
      - description

TODOS
   DONE the tags should be case sensitive
   DONE don't make it all in one method
   DONE check if one field is already filled (don't wipe out when adding something)
   DONE check if the file we will write has the same extension than what is in the drop down menu
   TODO add check box to know if we can translate a directory + backend
   TODO add all EAD tags in HashMap
   DONE translate special XML characters

BUGS
   FIXED <lb/> not read

Interpreter :  read the tree of the file
               each time you encounter a tag that could contain something interesting keep on searching
                                       a tag that doesn't contain anything valuable stop
                                       a tag that can be simplified to the value (or value of an attribute it contains), simplify and put it in the HashMap
               finally you get a HashMap containing all the fields of the database and their value

               => 3 types :   - keep on going down the tree
                              - get what's inside and that correspond to a database field
                              - you've gone too far, there might be a problem with the file
