TODOS
   DONE the tags should be case sensitive
   DONE don't make it all in one method
   DONE check if one field is already filled (don't wipe out when adding something)
   DONE check if the file we will write has the same extension than what is in the drop down menu
   DONE add check box to know if we can translate a directory + backend
   DONE add all EAD tags in HashMap
   DONE translate special XML characters
   DONE parser returns false if the file cannot be translated (=> don't create it)
   DONE add clear output button
   NOPE TODO translate directories recursively + add checkbox?

   TODO multiple manuscripts in one XML file (!!!)
   DONE replace numérisation-fac-similé
   DONE contentscope in contenu
   DONE custodhist placed in contenu CHECK
   DONE put things that have not Thomas's consent in a debug field
   DONE cotes (take the first word)
   DONE date -> siècle
   DONE add BNF field
   DONE remove .tsv
   DONE translate directories in only one file

BUGS
   FIX <lb/> not read
   FIX twice french in drop down menu at the start of the program
   FIX read all the first line
   FIX not all is reset when translating a directory
   BUG unicode not recognized by FileMaker (add BOM?) NEED FEEDBACK
   FIX generating output file name when translating several files to several files produces an invalid output file name (/.../dir.txt/file.txt)

CHECKS
   CHECK should I really have put custodhist in contenu?

Interpreter :  read the tree of the file
               each time you encounter a tag that could contain something interesting keep on searching
                                       a tag that doesn't contain anything valuable stop
                                       a tag that can be simplified to the value (or value of an attribute it contains), simplify and put it in the HashMap
               finally you get a HashMap containing all the fields of the database and their value

               => 3 types :   - keep on going down the tree
                              - get what's inside and that correspond to a database field
                              - you've gone too far, there might be a problem with the file
